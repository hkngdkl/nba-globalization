# How the NBA Became Global

## Overview
This project analyzes how the share of Non-USA players entering the NBA has changed since 1990.  
Using a self-collected dataset of over 5,000 NBA players, the analysis focuses on entry cohorts — counting players only in the year they first appeared in the league.

---

## Dataset
The dataset was programmatically collected from publicly available sources and includes:

- player_name  
- player_url  
- country  
- debut_year  

Each player is counted only once in their debut year to avoid cumulative bias.
